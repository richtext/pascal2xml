# pascal2xml
Set of classes to serialize pascal objects to/from xml. Compatible with Delphi and Lazarus.

Some considerations:

1. To instantiate an object from a xml, this xml needs to be created by class TObjectToXML. You need to implement a TXMLToObject.OnCreateObject event to do it. 


It's possible to use in Delphi, with some changes. I'll post it in the future.
